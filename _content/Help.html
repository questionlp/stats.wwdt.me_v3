<h3 id="h-notes">Notes</h3>
<p>
Please note that since not all of the information about every show, panelist, guest,
scores and Bluff the Listener segment data has been entered into the site's database,
there will be some gaps in the data presented. The time required to capture and enter
in the missing data makes it something that will happen over a period of time.
</p>

<h3 id="h-show">Show Information</h3>
<p>
Each show entry on this site includes the date in which the show aired, not when it is
taped, along with a note if it is a Best Of compliation show or a repeat. If the show
is a repeat, a link to the original airing of the show is provided.
</p>

<p>
The first row of the show information table includes the location, and venue if available,
where a show is taped and the show's host and scorekeeper.
</p>

<p>
The second row of the show information table lists the panelists that made an appearance,
his/her score (no scores recorded for Best Of shows) and score breakdown. The score breakdown,
if entered into the database, shows the number of points each panelist has had at the start
of Lightning Fill-in-the-Blank and the number of questions answered correctly.
</p>

<p>
The color coding of the panelist name and score denotes the panelist's ranking/placement at
the end of the show with bolded orange and bolded red being 1st and 2nd respectively.
Non-bolded orange and non-bolded red mean that the panelist came in tied for first or tied
for second respectively. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking">Standard competition
ranking</a> method is used throughout the site.
</p>

<p>
The next field on the second row displays, if available, which panelist's Bluff the Listener
story was chosen by the Listener contestant and which panelist had the correct story.
</p>

<p>
The last field on the second row lists the guests that made an appearance on the show and the
score at the end of the Not My Job segment. If there is an "*" after the guest's score, it
denotes that an exception was made. Refer to the original show's notes for the explanation of
the exception.
</p>

<p>
The last two rows of the table provide a run-down of the show segments (excluding non-unique
panelist rounds) and any additional notes recorded for that show.
</p>

<h3 id="h-pnl">Panelist Information</h3>
<p>
The first row of information displayed for each panelist focus on the panelist's appearances
and scoring. The first field lists the number of times a panelist has appeared on a show.
"Appearances" includes shows that are not repeats or Best Of shows. "Appearances with R/B" includes all shows,
including repeats and Best Ofs. "Appearances with Score" includes shows in which a score has been
entered in for that panelist.
</p>

<p>
The next field provides a breakdown of how often a panelist has ranked first, tied for first, second,
tied for second or third at the end of the Lightning Fill-in-the-Blank round. The precentage is calculated
by dividing the ranking number by the number of Apperances with Score. As noted in the above section,
the ranking method used throughout this site is follows the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking">standard competition ranking</a> rules.
</p>

<p>
The lowest, highest and average scores are all based on panelist score data that has been entered into the
database.
</p>

<p>
The second row displays the last time that the panelist has won outright (came in first) and the last time
the panelist either won outright or was tied for first.
</p>

<p>
The third row displays the number of times, based on the data recorded, that a panelist's story was chosen
by the listener contestant during the Bluff the Listener round, and how many times the panelist has had the
correct story.
</p>

<p>
Depending on whether panelist score information is available and the number of times a panelist has been on
the show, one or two graphs will be presented for each panelist. The first graph provides breakdown of how
many times a panelist has scored a certain number of points. The second graph, if available, plots out the
panelist's scores over time. The leftmost point is his/her first appearance and each successive point represents
each appearance, excluding Best Of and Repeat shows.
</p>

<p>
When viewing information for an individual panelist, a full listing of shows which the panelist has appeared
on, along with any scores enetered and the panelist's placement. Repeat shows are marked with "(R)", Best Of
shows marked with "(B)" and repeat of Best Of shows marked with "(R/B)".
