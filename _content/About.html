<h2>About</h2>

<p>
My name is Linh Pham and I am <em>slightly</em> obsessed with NPR's 
"<a href="http://waitwait.npr.org/">Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!</a>". Okay, with that
off of my chest...
</p>

<p>
The Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! Stats and Show Details page started out as a very basic
database that was used to collect interesting tidbits regarding Wait Wait shows that I
heard on the air. Eventually, I became quite obsessed with the show and the database
grew. I then decided to create a site to present all of the information that I had
collected.
</p>

<p>
One of the inspirations that I had when building this site was
<a href="http://www.mrkland.com/zone/WWDTM/index.htm">mrk.'s Wait Wait Don't Tell Me
Statistics Pages</a>. I used some of the information from that page to fill in some of the
information about shows prior to <a href="http://petersagal.com">Peter Sagal</a>
becoming the show's host.
</p>

<p>
All of the information presented on this page was collected from various public resources,
including the <a href="http://waitwait.npr.org/">Wait Wait Don't Tell Me! website</a>,
information written down from the program's broadcasts, podcasts and archival recordings.
Sometimes I find information regarding upcoming programs were obtained from information
posted about upcoming live tapings, as provided by
<a href="http://www.wbez.org/content/wait-wait-dont-tell-me-schedule-faquiz">Chicago Public Radio</a>.
<p>

<p>
If you are wondering, I do not work for nor am I affiliated with <a href="http://npr.org">NPR</a>,
<a href="http://chicagopublicradio.org/default.aspx">Chicago Public Radio</a> or
Urgent Haircut Productions.

<h3>What's New In Version 3.0?</h3>

<p>
What you see now is the third version of the site that now focuses on being more
mobile/tablet friendly and providing features that had been requested over the years. The
following new features have been implemented:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>You are now able to view information about each show individually, in addition
		to shows by each month and each year.</li>
	<li>When viewing shows for a given month or year, you can change the sort order
		to list newer shows first or older shows first.</li>
	<li>An additional field has been added to the page that will list where the show
		was taped. I don't have all of that information at the ready and it will be added
		over the next couple of months.</li>
	<li>Another new field lists which panelist's bluff was chosen by the listener and
		which bluff was the correct one. Again, I do not have all of that information at
		the ready and will be added over the next couple of months.</li>
	<li>In addition to the panelist scores, I have added (for the data that I have
		entered) the number of points each panelist started with at the beginning of the
		Lightning Fill-in-the-Blank round and how many questions each panelist answered
		correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p>
One of the more significant changes was to move the show description and notes below the
host, scorekeeper, panelists and guests block. I wanted to put the focus back on to the
panelists, guests and everyone else that is on the show.
</p>

<p>
Another significant change that I made was to move off the panelist statistics to its
own page. If you click on the name of the panelist on the Panelists page, you will get to
see the list of shows that the panelist has appeared on (excluding repeats and Best Of
shows).
</p>

<p>
To help make the site more friendly to smartphones and tablets, the site has been
designed and developed to be <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer">HTML5</a>
and <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">CSS 3 </a>compliant.
